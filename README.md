My dataset consists of 16 variables. Siz of them are binary variables which make it difficult to visulize. I like figure 7  which gives me an histogram of each variable in the same figure giving quick glance at each variable and its distribution. For me scattered plot seems to be more useful as seen in figure three binary variables are not very able to be visulized on a scatter plot. Fig 10 seems to be one of the more appropriate for me, however more investigation needs to be done -  a correlation heatmap will be the next step for me and regression analysis to try to explain the relation between my variable and the ten year outcome
